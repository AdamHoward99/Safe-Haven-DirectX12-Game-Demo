<h1 align="center">Safe Haven - DirectX12</h1>
<p align="center">This application is an vertical slice demo of a farming/survival game created using the DirectX12 API. This project required the creation of both the game and the game's engine simultaneously; a basic DX12 engine was provided that we built upon. Art assets for the game were created as placeholders but unfortunately we were unable to get hold of any game artists during the project. This repository only contains the demo application.</p>

## Gameplay Features
The aim of the game is to complete 4 areas by defeating all enemies present in that area in order to advance; with each passing area the amount of enemies increases. In addition to defeating enemies, you will also need to survive the harsh environment filled with poison or slowing traps. One way to do this is to farm plants which can provide you with items to heal, another way is to trade with the locals to get better equipment such as stronger weapons.

An additional aim to the game is to obtain the highest score and claim the top spot on the game's leaderboard. You can earn score points by killing enemies, levelling up or harvesting plants. The added score system provides a high risk, high reward mentality for the game.

Game Features:
- Score System & Leaderboards
- Farming Mechanics (Planting and Harvesting plants)
- Combat (Including multiple enemy types and animations for player/enemy attacks)
- Trading Mechanics
- Area Traps (Poison Traps, Slow Traps, Ice Traps)
- Levelling Up System which gives the player increased stats
- Looting Mechanics (Obtain items from destroyed houses)
